# Lab | APIs (Closest coffee shops)

## Introduction

In this lab, you will be using the 4sq Places API to retrieve information. 

Make sure you limit your queries so you don't run queries on a loop. Always loop up limit methods.

Here's some [docs](https://location.foursquare.com/developer/reference/places-api-get-started)

## Getting Started

Open the `challenge-1.ipynb`, `challenge-2.ipynb` and `challenge-3.ipynb` files in `your-code` directory. Follow the instructions and complete each challenge.

## Deliverables

`challenge-1.ipynb`, `challenge-2.ipynb` and `challenge-3.ipynb` with your responses to each of the exercises.

## Submission

Upon completion, add your deliverables to git. Then commit git and push your branch to the remote.
